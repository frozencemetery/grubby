.SH NAME
installkernel \- tool to script kernel installation

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBinstallkernel\fR \fI<kernel-version> <bootimage> <mapfile>\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBinstallkernel\fR installs a new kernel image onto the system from
the Linux source tree. It is called by the Linux kernel makefiles when
\fBmake install\fR is invoked there.

The new kernel is installed into {directory}/vmlinuz-{version}. If a
symbolic link {directory}/vmlinuz already exists, it is refreshed by
making a link from {directory}/vmlinuz to the new kernel, and the
previously installed kernel is available as {directory}/vmlinuz.old.
