What should grubby look like:
1) grubby the binary
  1) split each bootloader handler into a separate file
  2) split utility functions for bootloader handles into utils.c or somesuch
  3) no variables in configFileInfo, only getters/setters/RMW state changing
     callbacks
  4) readConfig() doesn't manipulate configFile except to add Entry/Line state
     to it
  5) meta-level parsing happens after readConfig, using configFileInfo
     callbacks
  6) top level functionality to be exposed with library API
  7) maintain 100% test suite compatibility
